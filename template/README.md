# Template for smart contract autogeneration

This is how full autogenerated contract should look like.

For more details look into [diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1lFjd1F1ZLVvQ7sNsJaMLqQKsmHy__KIMWUW3OL1UrYQ/edit?usp=sharing)

# Input parameters

Inputs for autogenerator will be:

* **sc_name**
* **execution_type** - can be public, private, shielded, deshielded.

# Proposed workflow for sc development

Developer creates smart contract library, look [sc_example](./sc_example/).

This library must depend on [sc_core](../sc_core/) library. 

In this library developer must implement a number of traits and structures. For more details look into diagram and example.

Autogenerator takes this [template](./zk_test_template/) and on its basis creates full contract.
