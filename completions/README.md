### Installation

#### Vanilla Zsh

1. Create a completions directory:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
   ```

2. Copy the completion file:

   ```sh
   cp ./zsh/_wallet ~/.zsh/completions/
   ```

3. Add to your `~/.zshrc` (before any `compinit` call, or add these lines if you don't have one):

   ```sh
   fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
   autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
   ```

4. Reload your shell:

   ```sh
   exec zsh
   ```

#### Oh-My-Zsh

1. Create the plugin directory and copy the file:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/wallet
   cp _wallet ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/wallet/
   ```

2. Add `wallet` to your plugins array in `~/.zshrc`:

   ```sh
   plugins=(... wallet)
   ```

3. Reload your shell:

   ```sh
   exec zsh
   ```

### Requirements

The completion script calls `wallet account list` to dynamically fetch account IDs. Ensure the `wallet` command is in your `$PATH`.

### Usage

```sh
# Main commands
wallet <TAB>

# Account subcommands
wallet account <TAB>

# Options for auth-transfer send
wallet auth-transfer send --<TAB>

# Account types when creating
wallet account new <TAB>
# Shows: public  private

# Account IDs (fetched dynamically)
wallet account get --account-id <TAB>
# Shows: Public/...  Private/...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Completions not appearing

1. Check that `compinit` is called in your `.zshrc`
2. Rebuild the completion cache:

   ```sh
   rm -f ~/.zcompdump*
   exec zsh
   ```

### Account IDs not completing

Ensure `wallet account list` works from your command line.
