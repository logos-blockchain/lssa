//! Test-only constructors for otherwise-opaque state types.

//! A [`ValidatedStateDiff`] can normally only be produced by the transaction validation
//! functions, which guarantees it has been checked before any state mutation. These
//! helpers let downstream crates unit-test *post-execution* validation logic — e.g. the
//! system-account and bridge guards in `common` — against a hand-built diff, without
//! running a program in the zkVM.
