//! Flash swap initiator, demonstrates the "prep → callback → assert" pattern using
//! generalized multi tail-calls with `self_account_id` and `caller_account_id`.
//!
//! # Pattern
//!
//! A flash swap lets a program optimistically transfer tokens out, run arbitrary user
//! logic (the callback), then assert that invariants hold after the callback. The entire
//! sequence is a single atomic transaction: if any step fails, all state changes roll back.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! This program handles two instruction variants:
//!
//! - `Initiate` (external): the top-level entrypoint. Emits 3 chained calls:
//!   1. Token transfer out (vault → receiver)
//!   2. User callback (arbitrary logic, e.g. arbitrage)
//!   3. Self-call to `InvariantCheck` (using `self_account_id` to reference itself)
//!
//! - `InvariantCheck` (internal): enforces that the vault balance was restored after the callback.
//!   Uses `caller_account_id == Some(self_account_id)` to prevent standalone calls (this is the
//!   visibility enforcement mechanism).
//!
//! # What this demonstrates
//!
//! - `self_account_id`: enables a program to chain back to itself (step 3 above)
//! - `caller_account_id`: enables a program to restrict which callers can invoke an instruction
//! - No intermediate-state prediction: each chained call only names its accounts by id, so the
//!   initiator never has to predict what an earlier call in the chain produced.
//! - Atomic rollback: if the callback doesn't return funds, the invariant check fails, and all
//!   state changes from steps 1 and 2 are rolled back automatically.
//!
//! # Tests
//!
//! See `lee/src/state.rs` for integration tests:
//! - `flash_swap_successful`: full round-trip, funds returned, state unchanged
//! - `flash_swap_callback_keeps_funds_rollback`: callback keeps funds, full rollback
//! - `flash_swap_self_call_targets_correct_program`: zero-amount self-call isolation test
//! - `flash_swap_standalone_invariant_check_rejected`: `caller_account_id` access control
