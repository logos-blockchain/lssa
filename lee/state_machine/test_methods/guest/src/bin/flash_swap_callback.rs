//! Flash swap callback, the user logic step in the "prep → callback → assert" pattern.
//!
//! # Role
//!
//! This program is called as chained call 2 in the flash swap sequence:
//! 1. Token transfer out (vault → receiver)
//! 2. **This callback** (user logic)
//! 3. Invariant check (assert vault balance restored)
//!
//! In a real flash swap, this would contain the user's arbitrage or other logic.
//! In this test program, it is controlled by `return_funds`:
//!
//! - `return_funds = true`: emits a token transfer (receiver → vault) to return the funds. The
//!   invariant check will pass and the transaction will succeed.
//!
//! - `return_funds = false`: emits no transfers. Funds stay with the receiver. The invariant check
//!   will fail (vault balance < initial), causing full atomic rollback. This simulates a malicious
//!   or buggy callback that does not repay the flash loan.
//!
//! # Note on `caller_account_id`
//!
//! This program does not enforce any access control on `caller_account_id`.
//! It is designed to be called by the flash swap initiator but could in principle be
//! called by any program. In production, a callback would typically verify the caller
//! if it needs to trust the context it is called from.
