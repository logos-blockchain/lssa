Feature: Sequencer registration — a first Stake turns balance into stake

  # Node-level (L3) registration coverage: a first Stake turns balance into
  # stake. Every scenario runs against a deployed LEZ stack: transactions are
  # signed and submitted through the scenario wallet, executed by the real
  # sequencer, and every assertion reads state back through the sequencer's
  # RPC API. The @P-NN tags are stable case ids.
  #
  # Rejection semantics at node level: an invalid transaction is admitted to
  # the mempool and only fails during block building, where the builder drops
  # it from the block without surfacing the in-program rejection reason
  # through any API. Rejection scenarios therefore assert non-inclusion plus
  # unchanged accounts; the expected in-program reason is kept as a comment
  # on each scenario and stays pinned by sequencer_core's unit tests.
  #
  # The non-inclusion protocol depends on two node properties that no API
  # documents or pins; if either changes, the rejection scenarios weaken to
  # vacuous passes rather than failing:
  # - mempool admission is synchronous with the send RPC reply, so a tip read
  #   after submission is at or past the admission point
  # - the block builder pulls the whole mempool on every turn, so two blocks
  #   past that tip guarantee a post-admission pull tried the transaction;
  #   this is the "within the next 2 blocks" window each rejection step names
  # Should the node ever gain a transaction status API (pending, included, or
  # dropped with a reason), replace the two-block window with it.
  #
  # Registration cases not ported:
  # - P-15, P-16 need a bad-mover guest
  # - P-17, P-19 need a chained-caller guest
  # - P-21 needs a second mover program fitting Stake's two-account slot
  # - G-01..G-03 exercise genesis builders private to sequencer_core, where
  #   G-01 and G-02 are already covered

  Background:
    Given a LEZ stack with fast blocks and configured public accounts
    And the sequencer_stake config account is at the default minimum stake
    And a sequencer key with no config entry
    And a default-owned, unclaimed ownership account for the sequencer key
    And a funding account holding "ten times the minimum stake"

  @stake_registration_ci @P-01 @P0 @L3
  # Mirrors the registration leg of tests/sequencer_stake_demo.rs,
  # additionally asserting the config entry and both balance deltas.
  Scenario: Happy-path registration through authenticated_transfer
    When a Stake of "twice the minimum stake" is submitted
    Then the stake transaction is accepted
    And the config entry tracks the staked amount with no pending unstake
    And the config entry points at the ownership account
    And the ownership account is claimed by sequencer_stake backing the sequencer key with no pending unstake
    And the ownership account balance increased by the staked amount
    And the funding account balance decreased by the staked amount

  @stake_registration_ci @P-02 @P0 @L3
  # In-program reason: "an initial stake must already meet the minimum".
  Scenario: Registration one below the minimum is rejected
    When a Stake of "one below the minimum stake" is submitted
    Then the stake transaction is not included within the next 2 blocks
    And the ownership account is not claimed
    And the config has no entry for the sequencer key
    And the stake accounts are unchanged

  @stake_registration_ci @P-03 @P0 @L3
  # The boundary is ≥ and genesis relies on it.
  Scenario: Registration at exactly the minimum is accepted
    When a Stake of "the minimum stake" is submitted
    Then the stake transaction is accepted
    And the config entry tracks the staked amount with no pending unstake

  @stake_registration_ci @P-04 @P0 @L3
  # In-program reason: "must sign for the ownership account".
  Scenario: Registration without the ownership account's signature is rejected
    When a Stake of "twice the minimum stake" is submitted without the ownership account's signature
    Then the stake transaction is not included within the next 2 blocks
    And the stake accounts are unchanged

  @stake_registration_ci @P-13 @P1 @L3
  # In-program reason: "not a sequencer_stake ownership account". The plan
  # names the token program as the foreign owner; at node level the only
  # foreign owner reachable through deployed programs is
  # authenticated_transfer, which claims a default-owned recipient on a
  # signed transfer. The guest's owner check rejects both the same way.
  Scenario: Ownership account owned by another program is rejected
    Given the ownership account is already claimed by the authenticated_transfer program
    When a Stake of "twice the minimum stake" is submitted
    Then the stake transaction is not included within the next 2 blocks
    And the config has no entry for the sequencer key
    And the stake accounts are unchanged

  @stake_registration_ci @P-14 @P0 @L3
  # In-program reason: "not the sequencer_stake config account". Mirrors
  # lez/sequencer/core/src/tests.rs::an_ownership_account_cannot_stand_in_for_the_config_account
  # for the Stake path: the stand-in is owned by sequencer_stake too, so only
  # the id check can reject it.
  Scenario: An ownership account cannot stand in for the config account
    Given a second sequencer key staked through its own ownership account
    When a Stake of "twice the minimum stake" is submitted with the second ownership account standing in for the config account
    Then the stake transaction is not included within the next 2 blocks
    And the ownership account is not claimed
    And the stake accounts are unchanged

  @stake_registration_ci @P-25 @P0 @L3
  # In-program reason: "Sender has insufficient balance" — the mover call
  # itself fails, so the whole transaction is rejected atomically. The most
  # common real-world rejection on the stake-in walk.
  Scenario: Funding account holds less than the amount
    Given a funding account holding "one below the minimum stake"
    When a Stake of "the minimum stake" is submitted
    Then the stake transaction is not included within the next 2 blocks
    And the ownership account is not claimed
    And the config has no entry for the sequencer key
    And the stake accounts are unchanged

  @stake_registration_ci @P-18 @P0 @L3
  # In-program reason: "ConfirmStake can only be invoked as a self-chained
  # call". The ownership balance already matches the expected post-balance,
  # so the caller check is the only assert that can reject it.
  Scenario: ConfirmStake submitted top-level is rejected
    When a ConfirmStake matching the current ownership balance is submitted as a top-level transaction
    Then the stake transaction is not included within the next 2 blocks
    And the stake accounts are unchanged

  @stake_registration_ci @P-20 @P2 @L3
  # In-program reason: "Stake requires a funding account, an ownership
  # account, and the config account".
  Scenario Outline: Wrong pre-state account count is rejected
    When a Stake of "the minimum stake" is submitted with <count> pre-state accounts
    Then the stake transaction is not included within the next 2 blocks
    And the stake accounts are unchanged

    Examples:
      | count |
      | 2     |
      | 4     |

  @stake_registration_ci @P-23 @P1 @L3
  # ⚠️ Diverges further from the plan than the earlier L1 port did. The plan
  # expects acceptance with expected_balance_after = donation + amount; at L1
  # the runtime instead rejected the Stake because the donation had made the
  # unclaimed ownership account non-default (validate_execution rule 6). At
  # node level even the donated pre-state is unreachable: claiming a
  # default-owned recipient needs the recipient's signature, so a plain
  # transfer at an unclaimed account is itself dropped
  # (ClaimedUnauthorizedAccount) and the account stays fresh. This scenario
  # pins that behaviour and shows registration is unaffected afterwards.
  # Revisit with the plan's §12 decisions.
  Scenario: A donation cannot reach an unclaimed ownership account before the first Stake
    When a donation of 25 to the unclaimed ownership account is submitted
    Then the donation transaction is not included within the next 2 blocks
    And the ownership account is not claimed
    And the stake accounts are unchanged
    When a Stake of "twice the minimum stake" is submitted
    Then the stake transaction is accepted
    And the ownership account balance increased by the staked amount

  @stake_registration_ci @P-24 @P1 @L3
  # The borsh half mirrors sequencer_stake core's
  # a_non_curve_point_is_not_a_sequencer_key; the serde/instruction half is
  # the 🆕 path of the plan: an off-curve Stake never reaches the handler
  # (the instruction decode panics inside the zkVM guest and surfaces as a
  # program-execution failure).
  Scenario: SequencerKey accepts only Ed25519 curve points
    Given 32 bytes that are not an Ed25519 curve point
    Then the bytes are not decodable as a SequencerKey
    And a StakeRecord carrying the bytes fails to decode
    And an Instruction carrying the bytes fails to deserialize
    When a Stake carrying the off-curve key bytes is submitted
    Then the stake transaction is not included within the next 2 blocks
    And the stake accounts are unchanged
