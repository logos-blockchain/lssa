Feature: Authenticated transfers

  @auth_transfer_ci
  # Mirrors integration_tests/tests/auth_transfer/public.rs::successful_transfer_to_existing_account.
  # Coverage is equivalent for the transfer behavior and stronger for lifecycle coverage:
  # Cucumber also verifies indexer convergence and explicit runtime teardown. It uses balance
  # deltas instead of the legacy test's fixed 9900/20100 values.
  Scenario: Transfer funds between configured public accounts
    Given a LEZ stack with configured public accounts
    When I transfer 100 from the first configured public account to the second as "PUBLIC_TRANSFER"
    Then the sender balance for transfer "PUBLIC_TRANSFER" decreases by 100
    And the receiver balance for transfer "PUBLIC_TRANSFER" increases by 100
    And transfer "PUBLIC_TRANSFER" is included in a block within 120 seconds
    And only the sender signs transfer "PUBLIC_TRANSFER"
    And the indexer catches up to transfer "PUBLIC_TRANSFER" within 120 seconds
    Then I stop the runtime

  @auth_transfer_ci
  # Mirrors integration_tests/tests/auth_transfer/public.rs::transfer_beyond_balance_is_refused_client_side.
  # The attempted amount is more than the observed sender balance, so this remains factual if
  # the configured genesis balances or fee policy changes.
  Scenario: Reject a public transfer with insufficient sender balance
    Given a LEZ stack with configured public accounts
    When I attempt to transfer more than the first configured public account balance to the second
    Then the transfer is rejected
    And the sender balance remains unchanged
    And the sender nonce remains unchanged
    And the receiver balance remains unchanged
    And the indexer catches up to the sequencer within 120 seconds
    Then I stop the runtime

  @auth_transfer_ci
  # Mirrors integration_tests/tests/auth_transfer/public.rs::two_consecutive_successful_transfers.
  # Coverage is equivalent for the final balances and nonce progression, with additional checks
  # for both inclusions, sender-only signatures, indexer convergence, and runtime teardown. It
  # does not retain the legacy test's intermediate balance checkpoint after the first transfer.
  Scenario: Execute two consecutive transfers between configured public accounts
    Given a LEZ stack with configured public accounts
    When I transfer 100 from the first configured public account to the second as "FIRST_TRANSFER"
    And I transfer 100 from the first configured public account to the second as "SECOND_TRANSFER"
    Then the sender balance across transfers "FIRST_TRANSFER" and "SECOND_TRANSFER" decreases by 200
    And the receiver balance across transfers "FIRST_TRANSFER" and "SECOND_TRANSFER" increases by 200
    And transfer "FIRST_TRANSFER" is included in a block within 120 seconds
    And transfer "SECOND_TRANSFER" is included in a block within 120 seconds
    And only the sender signs transfer "FIRST_TRANSFER"
    And only the sender signs transfer "SECOND_TRANSFER"
    And the sender nonce advances across transfers "FIRST_TRANSFER" and "SECOND_TRANSFER"
    And the indexer catches up to transfer "SECOND_TRANSFER" within 120 seconds
    Then I stop the runtime

  @auth_transfer_ci
  # Mirrors integration_tests/tests/auth_transfer/public.rs::successful_transfer_to_new_account.
  # Coverage is equivalent for funding a previously absent public account. Cucumber additionally
  # verifies the recipient is absent before submission, transaction inclusion, both required
  # signatures, indexer convergence, and explicit runtime teardown.
  Scenario: Transfer funds to a new public account
    Given a LEZ stack with configured public accounts
    And a new public account
    When I transfer 100 from the first configured public account to the new account as "NEW_ACCOUNT_TRANSFER"
    Then the sender balance for transfer "NEW_ACCOUNT_TRANSFER" decreases by 100
    And the new account balance for transfer "NEW_ACCOUNT_TRANSFER" is 100
    And transfer "NEW_ACCOUNT_TRANSFER" is included in a block within 120 seconds
    And the sender and new account sign transfer "NEW_ACCOUNT_TRANSFER"
    And the indexer catches up to transfer "NEW_ACCOUNT_TRANSFER" within 120 seconds
    Then I stop the runtime

  @auth_transfer_ci
  # Mirrors integration_tests/tests/auth_transfer/private.rs::private_transfer_to_owned_account.
  # Coverage preserves the post-transfer commitment checks and additionally verifies private
  # balances, transaction inclusion, indexer convergence, and explicit runtime teardown.
  Scenario: Transfer funds between configured private accounts
    Given a LEZ stack with configured private accounts
    When I transfer 100 from the first configured private account to the second as "PRIVATE_TRANSFER"
    Then the sender private balance for transfer "PRIVATE_TRANSFER" decreases by 100
    And the receiver private balance for transfer "PRIVATE_TRANSFER" increases by 100
    And the sender private commitment for transfer "PRIVATE_TRANSFER" is in sequencer state
    And the receiver private commitment for transfer "PRIVATE_TRANSFER" is in sequencer state
    And transfer "PRIVATE_TRANSFER" is included in a block within 120 seconds
    And the indexer catches up to transfer "PRIVATE_TRANSFER" within 120 seconds
    Then I stop the runtime
